Hi, I'm Sisay Adugna Chala. I work for Fraunhofer FIT as a researcher in Data Science and AI. I started at Fraunhofer FIT as Software Engineer in the User-Centered Ubiquitous Computing team. I obtained my PhD in Computer Science from University of Siegen, where I was a Marie Curie ITN Fellow working on data-intensive personalized vacancy recommendation, and assisting in teaching software engineering for mechatronics international program.

Earlier, I worked for Haramaya University (Ethiopia) as an ICT Director and system administrator on Linux and Windows network environments for over three years. I also taught in the same university for more than eight years. Moreover, I conducted research on Statistical Machine Translation when I was a visiting researcher at German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) based in Saarland University.  

At Fraunhofer FIT, I am involved in projects that work in the area of smart data analytics. Notable projects I am actively working on are Storage4Grid where we study energy consumption prediction, and GOEASY in which we study optimization of location based services.

I enjoy my stay at FIT due the conducive and vibrant working environment that encourages healthy work-life balance and sustainable productivity while tackling real-world challenges by applying multidisciplinary approaches.

My research interests include machine translation, data mining and machine learning, information retrieval, and application of ICT in various problem domains. My professional highlights:

  - Over 10 years of experience in university teaching and R&D
  - Over 15 years of experience in software development
  - More than 7 year of experience in project management and technical leadership
